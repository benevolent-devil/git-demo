## Some bullsh!t...
This course is designed for senior Linux system administrators who want to
validate their competencies by earning the RHCSA and RHCE credentials. It
combines the RHCSA Fast Track Course (RH199) and System Administration III
(RH254) courses, normally eight days of training, into a single 5-day course. Building
on the studentsâ€™ extensive knowledge of command line based Linux administration,
the course moves very quickly through the intermediate and advanced tasks
covered by lab-based knowledge checks and facilitative discussions. Upon
completion, students will have been exposed to all the intermediate and advanced
competencies tested by the RHCSA and RHCE exams.

### Surprise! Additional sh!tty addons
Solaris system administrators who have completed the Red Hat Enterprise Linux for Solaris
Administrators (RH290) course. This course is not recommended for students who have
successfully completed the RHCSA Rapid Track Course (RH200). For those students, the
Red Hat System Administration III (RH254) course is recommended.
